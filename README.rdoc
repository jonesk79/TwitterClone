For today's project, let's make a clone of Twitter.

Start off with user signups. When somebody signs up, send them a welcome email.
Then, let users post tweets. If another user's handle is mentioned in the tweet, send that user a notification email.
Now, let users follow each other. Hint: a user has_many :followed_users, :class_name => 'User', :through => :relationships; and a user has_many :followers, :class_name => 'User', :through => :relationships.
Let users upload photos in their tweets.
